# caschls
 Stata code for Common Core VA project and calschls survey data work for CA Ed Lab GSR. ./dta directory contains only publicly available data from California Department of Education.


## Notes
- Need to phase out local macros for where VA project directories are called such as `vaprojdofiles', use global macro $vaprojdir instead
